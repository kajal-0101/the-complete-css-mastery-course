## transform-origin
* used to set a fixed-point for the transform property.
* Syntax
	```
	Selector {
		transform-origin: x-axis y-axis z-axis;
	}
	```

### x-axis value
* it accepts three pre-defined values
	* left: center point of the left side of the element will be the origin.
	* center
	* right
* whenever, x-axis = left/center/right; the y-axis value is center.

### y-axis value
* it accepts three pre-defined values
	* top
	* center
	* bottom
* whenever, y-axis = top/ceneter/bottom; the x-axis value is center.

### summary
* the transform-origin property is used to set a fixed point for the transform property.
* the x-axis value represents the horizontal axis origin.
* the y-axis value represents the vertical axis origin.
* by default, both these values have the transform-origin value of center.
* we can also combine bth the x-axis and y-axis value for the transform-origin property.
