<!-- The HTML file has an div element.
The width and height of the div element is set to 300px.
Then, to make the div element a circle, the border-radius property has been set to 50%.
Next, to make the circle beautiful, gradient background has been used.
Next, to rotate the circle on hover state, I have used the transform property with a value of rotate(360deg).
Next, the transition property has been used to rotate the circle with a duration of 2s.
Finally, the circle has been positioned away from the top left corner in order to look at the rotation of the circle even better.
The task is to rotate the circle with the right side of the circle as its origin.
Basically, use the transform-origin property to set the right side of circle as its origin.
Use External CSS.
