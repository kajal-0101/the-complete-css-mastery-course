<!-- The HTML file has a div and an image tag.
The image is present inside the div element.
The width and height of the image is set to 300px.
A 15px dotted dark-blue border is set for the div element.
The display property with a value of inline-block has been used to keep the border only around the image and not occupy the entire width
The task is to reove the image that is present inside the div element using the visibility property.
Use only External CSS.-->
