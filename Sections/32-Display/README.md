## display
* In terms of display property, HTML elements are boradly divided into two categories:
	* block
	* inline
* Block Level elements takes up the entire width of the parent element.
* Block level elements starts in a new line.
* Some of the popular block level elements are:
	* heading
	* paragraph
	* div
	* section
	* lists
* Inline level elements takes up the space they need.
* Inline level elements do not start in a new line.
* All box-modal properties work for block level elements.
* Inline elements do not obey some box-model properties like:
	* height
	* width
	* margin-top
	* margin-bottom
* `block` value of `display` property is used to convert any HTML element into a block level element.
* `inline` value of `display` property is used to convert any HTML element into inline level element.
* `inline-block` value of `display` property is used to convert any HTML element into inline level element, but it has an advantage that all box-modal properties work for it.
* `none` value of `display` property is used to make the HTML element invisible though its presence can be checked through developers' tools like Chrome Developer Tool, mistly its not used in the real-world projects without inevitable requirements.
