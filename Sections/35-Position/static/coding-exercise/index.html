<!-- The HTML file has two div elements.
The parent div element has a class of parent and the child div element has a class of child.
Set the width and height of the parent div tag to 300px, also set a 10 px solid blue border for the parent div element.
Set the width and height of the child div tag to 150px.
Use the background-image property to set gradient as a background for the div element, use #f72585 and #7209b7 as the gradient colors.

Next, use the position proerty for the child element and set it to a value of static.
Then, use the top property for the child div element and set a value of 50px.
