<!-- First, inside the index.html, there is a heading tag.
There are some styles that is already applied to that h1 tag.
Your job is to create a transition for the text color and background color of the h1 tag.
Basically, when we hover over the h1 tag the text-color of the h1 tag should be changed to black and the background-color should be changed to yellow.
This effect should take a duration of 2s.
Remember, transition-property and transition-duration property are mandatory to apply a transition.
Use the transition property to select the CSS properties for transition.
Then, use the transition-timing-function property to control the speed of the transition.
Set a value of ease-in for the transition-timing-function.
Finally, use the transition-delay property to set a delay of 2s for the transition.
Remember, we can apply more than one transition by separating the transitions with a comma.
Use only External CSS.-->
