<!-- The HTML file has two div elements.
The parent div element has a class of parent and the child div element has a class of child.
Set the width and height of the parent div tag to 300px, also set a 10 px solid #ff0a54 border for the parent div element.
Set the width and height of the child div tag to 150px.
Use the background-image property to set gradient as a background for the div element, use #f80ffdb and #7400b8 as the gradient colors.
The direction of the gradient should be towards the right bottom.

Next, use the position property for the child div element and set it to a value of absolute.
The, use the right property for the child div element and set a value of 200px.


Remember when you use the absolute positioning and set 200px as a value for the right property then you can see the the child div will be positioned 200px towards left from the right side of the screen.
Use only External CSS -->
